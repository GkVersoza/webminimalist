                <p class="mbr-text testimonial-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Dr. Billy Carmack is the owner and clinic director for Carmack
<br>Chiropractic and Sports Therapy. He is a native Texan, growing up in
the Dallas area and attended the University of North Texas on a
basketball scholarship. Upon finishing his academic and basketball
career at UNT, Dr. Carmack traveled and worked throughout Europe for
3 years before discovering beach volleyball and relocating to Miami
Beach, FL. It was while competing on the East Coast pro-beach
volleyball circuit that he experienced the awesome power of
<br>chiropractic and physical medicine. The injuries and chronic conditions
that are a part of playing competitive sports had become debilitating
for Dr. Carmack at a time when he should have been at peak physical
condition and performance. <br><br>Through a combination of chiropractic
treatment, physical medicine and soft-tissue therapy, Dr. Carmack was
able to resume playing the sport he loved pain free and stronger than
ever. It was this experience that ultimately led him to return to school
to pursue his chiropractic degree with the desire to bring this life-changing healing experience to other athletes and all those suffering
from similar conditions. Although the “spark had been lit” from these
experiences, Dr. Carmack felt the time was not right and he continued
<br>traveling and playing beach volleyball. During this time – before
entering chiropractic college – Dr. Carmack returned to UNT as a
graduate student, earning a Master’s Degree in Kinesiology and Sports
Psychology. In 2006 Dr. Carmack returned to his hometown of Dallas to
attend Parker College of Chiropractic, graduating in 2008. He has spent
the last 10 years conceiving, developing and perfecting the Carmack
<br>Protocol for soft-tissue injury that is performed in the clinic today.
<br><br>Coupled with the amazing benefits of the chiropractic adjustment, we
believe there is no better way to treat sports injuries and the chronic
conditions of the modern world. Dr. Carmack has committed his life to
being the best healing professional he can be and hopes you are willing
to share the experience of healing your body with him!</p>

                    <p class="mbr-text testimonial-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Dr. Dixie Mayfield attended chiropractic school at Parker University in Dallas, TX, and is originally from Ardmore, OK.  She started her career in healthcare there as a licensed massage therapist, but quickly decided that her clients needed more than what massage could offer.  “How could I release muscle tissue but not address the joint dysfunction?”  “What would be the best way to make profound, life-long changes in peoples’ lives?”, she asked herself.  In her quest to answer these questions, Dr. Mayfield found chiropractic and her true passion.
<br>
<br>Since graduating from Parker University, Dr. Mayfield has sought to integrate soft tissue therapy, chiropractic and multiple modalities into her professional philosophy, always seeking “new and better ways to get people better!”  Upon meeting Dr. Carmack, she knew she had found her mentor and has continued to evolve and thrive under his tutelage.  She states, “The Carmack Protocol, in my opinion, is the perfect marriage between soft tissue work and the treatment of joint function.  It is the missing link I’ve been searching for all these years.  I am in awe of the advancements we continually make in patient care.  Every week I learn something new that benefits my patients and makes me a more capable doctor.  There is no musculoskeletal problem I wouldn’t take on with full confidence!”</p>
